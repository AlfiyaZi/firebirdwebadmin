      <p>
        This chapter is about the installation of FirebirdWebAdmin only. Information
        about setting up apache/php/firebird/interbase is omitted because there
        are countless books and online resources available which are covering
        these topics in depths. Bringing firebird/interbase support into php is
        the same procedure like with any other php extension. If you have
        problems with php, reading the
        <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php">installation
          chapter</a> of the php manual will be a good start.
      </p>
      <P>
        To install FirebirdWebAdmin on your webserver get the latest release package
        from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25198">
          sourceforge</a>. Copy the package to a location below of your
        webservers document root. Finally unpack the package using either tar
        or zip.
      </P>
      <p>
        For example, if you have chosen the tar package the steps to go are
      <p>
      <pre class="source">
&gt; cp FirebirdWebAdmin_X.X.tar.gz /var/www
&gt; cd /var/www
&gt; tar xfz FirebirdWebAdmin_X.X.tar.gz
</pre>
      <p>
        This will create a directory named FirebirdWebAdmin_X.X and you will be able
        to access the scripts with the URI
        http://yourhostname/FirebirdWebAdmin_X.X/index.html .
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning: All the following configuration steps will open potential security
        holes on a public accessable webserver. None of them is necessary if
        you only want to browse and edit data. But all further features will
        fail if this steps are not done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure that the binary tools (isql, gbak, gsec and friends)
        delivered with you database distribution are executable by the
        webserver via php's exec() function. The easiest (not best) way to do
        so is to make the tools world executable. The names for the tools are
        slightly different for windows/linux, firebird/interbase.
      </p>
      <pre class="source">
&gt; cd /usr/local/firebird/bin
&gt; for executable in isql gbak gfix gsec gstat
  do
      chmod a+x $executable
  done
&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
        If you are running php in the safe mode you have to take care that your
        php configuration did not disables the execution of these binaries.
        Check the php settings for safe_mode_exec_dir and disable_functions for
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The apache needs read permissions for the directories holding your
        database files if you are using the
        <a href="configuration.html#ALLOWED_DIRS">$ALLOWED_DIRS</a>
        configuration setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        To display database statistics the apache needs read permissions for
        the database file.
