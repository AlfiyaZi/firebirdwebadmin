Description: Web-based administration for the Firebird and Interbase database
 ibWebAdmin is a web frontend for the InterBase and Firebird database
 server. It makes the attempt to support all features which InterBase
 and SQL are offering. Even if this goal is unattainable, quite a few
 steps have already been done. By now ibWebAdmin has the basic
 functions for creating, deleting, modifying databases, tables,
 generators, triggers and domains. It lets you import, export, enter,
 edit, delete, query, browse your data.
