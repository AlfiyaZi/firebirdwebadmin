phpfirebirdadmin 2.0 is based on ibWebAdmin 2.0 code 
in fact i started with an  cvs import 
http://www.firebirdnews.org/?p=1599
then i modified to make work on ubuntu 
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2031365&forum_id=79364
and then i requested for commit access 
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1965661&forum_id=79364
but is faster to work on git 


OLD README
ibWebAdmin 0.98

  ibWebAdmin is a web frontend for the Firebird and InterBase
  database servers.


  By now it has the functionalities for
  
  o creating, deleting, modifying databases, tables, generators,
    views, triggers, domains, indices, stored procedures, udf's,
    exceptions, roles and database users

  o performing sql expressions on databases and display the results

  o import and export of data through files in the csv format

  o browsing through the contents of tables and views, watching them
    growing while typing in data

  o selecting data for deleting and editing while browsing tables

  o inserting, deleting, displaying the contents of blob fields

  o diplaying database metadata, browsing the interbase system tables

  o database backup and restore, database maintenance


  Some of the features are only available if the database- and the
  web-server are running on the same machine. The reason is that php
  have to call the interbase tools (isql, gsec, gstat, etc.) to
  perform certain actions.


  ibWebAdmin is under development and may contain serious bugs. 
  So make sure you never use it on any important datas. Use a copy of
  your database if you are working with this program.



Documentation

  There is no documentation available yet, but if you are familiar
  with Firebird or InterBase you will have no troubles using
  ibWebAdmin.

  For some basic configuration settings have a look to the file
  ./inc/configuration.inc.php befor you start the programm.

  If you are struggling with getting the interbase support into your
  W/LAMP-setup, please read the Beginners guide to Firebird and PHP:

  Here is how to use and install it on Ubuntu https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firebird2.1

  Firebird documentation is located on this page http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=doc




Requirements

  This is the environment I'm using for the development. Other
  components are not or less tested. So if you got problems make sure
  you are not using older software components.

  php5.x with compiled in support for InterBase and
  pcre (but any version >= 5.0 should work)
