    <h2>2. Requirements</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>a) Database Server</h3>
      <p>
        Either a <a href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/">FireBird</a> or
        an <a href="http://www.borland.com/interbase/server/index.html">
        Interbase</a> database server is needed. The classic server and the
        super server builds are nearly equivalent for ibWebAdmin's point
        of view. Only the server statistics are not supported for the super
        server builds. ibWebAdmin is tested and kown to run with Firebird 1.0
        and 1.5, Interbase Open Source 6.01, Interbase 6.5, 7.0 and 7.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to choose your database version on the database login panel
        to make sure that the correct and complete feature set for your
        database gets supported. The default server is configurable by the
        <a href="configuration.html#DEFAULT_SERVER">DEFAULT_SERVER</a> setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days most testing is done with FireBird 1.5 and Interbase 7.1 on
        a SuSE 9.1 Linux installation and with FireBird 1.5 on Windows 98
        inside of a <a href="http://www.vmware.com">vmware</a> virtual
        workstation.
      </p>
      <h3>b) Webserver</h3>
      <p>
        By theory it shouldn't make a big difference which webserver you are
        using as long as the server is supporting php in one ore another way.
        In practice I'm only sure for <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">
        apache</a> 1.3 and 2.0. So it would be nice to give me a note if you
        are running ibWebAdmin successfully with another webserver.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using ibWebAdmin through the internet you should consider
        to use an encrypted connection for security reasons, e.g. to use apache
        with <a href="http://www.modssl.org/">mod_ssl.</a> If you are accessing
        your database server throught the internet you can protect your
        sensitiv data by encrypting the tcp/ip datastream with the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zebedee/">zebedee</a> secure
        tunnel.
      </p>
      <h3>c) php</h3>
      <p>
        Beside of the webserver you will need <a href="http://www.php.net">php</a>
        support, either compiled into the webserver or as a loadable module or
        as a cgi program. Every version of php4 greaten than 4.02 and php5 are
        ok. The php you are using must include the interbase extension, either
        compiled into php or as a loadable module.
      </p>
      <p>
        ibWebAdmin is trying hard to take care for the various php
        configuration settings. But if you notice any troubles you should be
        save if you are going with the php.ini file that is coming with php
        named php.ini-dist.
      </p>
      <h3>d) Webbrowser</h3>
      <p>
        A recent <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla or Firefox</a>,
        <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/">Netscape 6/7+</a>
        or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/">Internet
        Explorer</a> with javascript and cookies enabled are recommended. Any
        other graphical browser should work. But the dhtml stuff that is used
        to improve the usability is only available with the mentioned browsers.
        Cookies are used to store the user configuration between sessions.
